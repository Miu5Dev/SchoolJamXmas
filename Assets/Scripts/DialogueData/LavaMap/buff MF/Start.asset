  dialogue:
  - You made it through the heat, not bad for someone who fell out of the sky.
  - Word's spreading fast, you know. They say an Elite Elf returned.
  - Two pieces of that sky-wreck landed here, we're lucky they didn't drop straight
    into the lava.
  - One's up on that high platform to my right, nearly slid off the edge when it
    crashed.
  - "The other's sitting right at the well\u2026 if only we were able to push the
    buttons again to get up there."
  - If you're really collecting these things, you'd better move fast before the ground
    decides to swallow 'em.
  - Good luck out there. Try not to become charcoal
