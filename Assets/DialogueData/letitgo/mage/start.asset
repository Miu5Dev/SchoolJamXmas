  dialogue:
  - Hey there! Nice to see someone else who isn't afraid of a little vertical challenge.
  - Peaple say that its impossible to get up ther
  - Just who the hell do you think i am!!!
  - These icicles have been frozen solid for years, perfect for climbing if you've
    got steady feet.
  - Looks like a chunk of wood wedged between the spires, definitely not natural.
  - If you're heading up, take your time. The ice won't break, but a rushed jump
    sure will.
  - Good luck up there, friend!
